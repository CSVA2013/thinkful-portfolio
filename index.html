      <h1>Hello! I'm Christopher Varela</h1>
      <p>I am a developer and I live in Dallas, Texas.</p>
        <p>I have always had a huge love for computers and coding is another love that came right with it. Reasons as to why I fell into this path.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Problem solving, although maybe very tedious at times, is a huge reason why I love coding so much. The satifaction after coming up with a solution is what I live for.</li>
          <li>Love creating code and watching actually work is a very good feeling aswell.</li>
          <li>Helping others with my knowledge is a big reason as well. I have always helped any one in need, now as a developer I can offer so much help to people that have websites or are need of one. Whatever the needs I would love to offer my help in anyway possible</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please take a look at my website and feel free to <a href="#contact">Contact Me!</a></p>

    <!-- About Me -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="border-top">About Christopher</h2>
        <p>While at a very young age, I was introduced to computers at school. Catching on very quickly with anything that was presented to me. You could say that I was the "nerd" in computer class, but I never card I loved learning all there is to computers.</p>

        <p>Now as a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, this has probably been the best decision I ever made. Learning anything dealing with code has been very intriguing and fun at the same time, really opening my eyes to what it is I really love doing.</a>

        <p>If you're looking for a really driven person that really loves his craft, I am that man for you! I'm always ready to tackle any challenges that are brought my way!</p>
